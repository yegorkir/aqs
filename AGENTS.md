# AGENTS.md

## Instructions
- If you need to maintain certain files to perform a task, you must use `docs/agent_tasks` path for it.
- Please create a folder inside `docs/agent_tasks` that reflects the task aim. If you work under a specific git branch, add its number as a prefix to the subfolder name.
- If the folder already exists, you must continue work in it. Note that the existing folder may not follow the previous naming convention, but you must determine the correct existing folder and continue maintaining files in it.

## Languages for ttc
- The main languages are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- The secondary language is Markdown

## Using MCP
- Always use context7 when you need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve the library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
- If you need to work with any JavaScript framework or UI library, first search its official documentation via context7.

## Modes

## Commit and stage
- Don't make a commit until I ask you directly.
- Don't add to stage the next files: `config.dev.yml`, `local_config.yml`, `Makefile`, if it isn't specified exactly.
- Don't add to stage `docs/memory_bank`, `docs/agent_rules`, `docs/agent_tasks`, `AGENTS.md` and other files generated by you.

## Variables into commands
If you want to launch some command and see in it some variable that is bordered by common syntax to determine such variable, you must see in the file from where you want to take this command to find the definition of this variable first. If you can't find the value for the variable, use it as-is in the launched command.

## Project Structure, Module Organization & some additional more detailed info
If you need, you can see the `docs/memory_bank` folder.

## Documentation updates
Every task done by you, if it affects the documentation or memory bank (`docs/memory_bank` folder), must add or change corresponding info.

## Validation requirement
- Always run the bundle validator after modifying any bundle-like files (e.g., `content/bundle.json`): `node scripts/validate_bundle.js`.

## Coding style preferences

### JavaScript
- Prefer modern ES modules and functional style where it improves clarity.
- Use `const` by default; use `let` only when reassignment is necessary.
- Avoid deeply nested conditionals; use early returns or guard clauses.
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation when interpolating.

### HTML
- Prefer semantic HTML elements (`header`, `main`, `section`, `nav`, `article`, `footer`).
- Keep markup accessible: include `alt` text, label form controls, and ensure proper heading hierarchy.

### CSS
- Prefer class-based styling over tag selectors.
- Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography scales.
- Avoid `!important` unless there is no reasonable alternative.
